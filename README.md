# Advent of Code in Prolog

## How to run

Get [SWI-Prolog](https://swi-prolog.org/) from your favorite package manager.
The version I'm using is 8.2.2, which is available in Debian repos as
`swi-prolog`.

## Inputs

Sign up to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to get puzzle inputs.

## Running

SWI-Prolog programs are not run directly. Open up a terminal and start `prolog`,
then:

```prolog
?- [code].
true.

?- start.
% ...
```

Note that an `input.txt` file (that day's input) needs to be present in the
working folder.
